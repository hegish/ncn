# with the default awi-cm settings we load an oldish netcdf-cxx-4.2.1 lib which causes the error "NcInDefineMode: Operation not allowed in define mode"
# this has been repored to DKRZ and they installed netcdf-cxx-4.3.0
# if we just update the NETCDF_CXX_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, we get duplicate symbols as our loaded netcdf_c-4.3.2-intel14 puts another libnetcdf.so in the rpath
# if we call
#   objdump -x /sw/rhel6-x64/netcdf/netcdf_cxx-4.3.0-gcc64/lib/libnetcdf_c++4.so.1.0.3 |grep RPATH
# we see that it has gcc-6.4.0 and netcdf_c-4.5.0-gcc64 in the rpath, so we use netcdf_c-4.5.0-gcc64 to make sure we do not have libnetcdf twice
# we also need a newer c++ compiler, gcc-4.8.2 seems to be too old. gcc-6.4 works
